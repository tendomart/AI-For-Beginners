It was included in two separate parts in the second episode of the series\\' eighth season, \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms\". In the first instance of the song, it was performed during the episode by character Podrick Payne, portrayed by Scottish actor Daniel Portman. The song then played during the episode\\'s end credits, performed by British indie rock band Florence and the Machine. Florence and the Machine released the song as a single the day after the episode aired, on 22 April 2019. The song was released by HBO and record label Universal Music Group.\\n\\n==Background==\\n\"Jenny of Oldstones\" is an adaptation of a song mentioned in George R. R. Martin\\'s fantasy novel series \\'\\'A Song of Ice and Fire\\'\\', on which \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\' is based. In the third novel in the series, \\'\\'A Storm of Swords\\'\\', a character asks for \"my Jenny\\'s song\" to be performed.

B. Weiss and David Benioff, who added lyrics to the fragment written in \\'\\'A Song of Ice and Fire\\'\\' by Martin. Florence and the Machine\\'s recording of it was produced by American musician Doveman and Florence and the Machine frontwoman Florence Welch. The song is a folk ballad, with influences of Celtic music. Weiss and Benioff reportedly approached Welch in 2012 to record the song \"The Rains of Castamere\", although she had turned down their request. Following the release of \"Jenny of Oldstones\", Welch stated in an interview with \\'\\'The New York Times\\'\\' that this was during her \"wild years\", when she was \"less focused\".\\n\\n', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 1, '_split_overlap': [{'doc_id': '8f6396e1ad6a2190794d75ca9134fe58', 'range': (0, 137)}, {'doc_id': 'a792f531af8d9cb28c2fbac9d2c62384', 'range': (880, 1052)}]}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '1075d9933f049801b8ff8766a4862780'}>,\n",

The song was however first heard performed by Daniel Portman as the character Podrick, who sang a verse in a sequence reminiscent of the scene in \\'\\'The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\\'\\' when Pippin sang \"The Edge of Night\" before the battle of Minas Tirith. The version sung by Portman is a simplified in its harmonies, while the version by Welch is close to how Djawadi originally wrote it with more chord changes.\\n\\n==Commercial performance==\\n\"Jenny of Oldstones\" debuted at number 75 in the UK and 64 in Ireland. It was the seventh best-selling digital song the week it was released in the United States.

What\\'s great about the scene, too, is there\\'s hardly any dialogue. It\\'s nine minutes long. I knew I had to start minimal and give it space. Let notes ring, then give it space, and build up the anticipation from there, without tipping in either direction.\"Djawadi stated that he refrained from using the typical Lannister theme, \"The Rains of Castamere\", in order to create more of a mystery.

And the organ as well.\"In another interview, Djawadi talked about the process, saying, \"That was the big guidance for me, in how I wanted to build this piece, It\\'s a different instrument, and I put it in an upper register, but the idea is that it\\'s building something that stays the same but changes over time.

Although his early books were well-received within the fantasy fiction community, his readership remained relatively small and Martin took on jobs as a writer in Hollywood in the mid-1980s. He worked principally on the revival of ''The Twilight Zone'' throughout 1986 and on ''Beauty and the Beast'' until 1990, but he also developed his own TV pilots and wrote feature film scripts. He grew frustrated that his pilots and screenplays were not getting made and that TV-related production limitations like budgets and episode lengths were forcing him to cut characters and trim battle scenes. This pushed Martin back towards writing books, where he did not have to worry about compromising the size of his imagination. Admiring the works of J. R. R.

Putting ''Avalon'' aside, Martin finished this chapter in a few days and grew certain that it was part of a longer story.

The material of the written 250-page prologue was mixed in as new viewpoint characters from Dorne and the Iron Islands.

For an American who speaks only English, the history of England proved the easiest source of medieval history for him, giving the series a British rather than a German or Spanish historic flavor. For example, Ned and Robb Stark resemble Richard, 3rd Duke of York, and his son Edward IV, and Queen Cersei resembles both Margaret of Anjou and Elizabeth Woodville. Martin immersed himself in many diverse medieval topics such as clothing, food, feasting, and tournaments to have the facts at hand if needed during writing. The series was in particular influenced by the Hundred Years' War, the Crusades, the Albigensian Crusade, and the Wars of the Roses, although Martin refrained from making any direct adaptations. Martin was also inspired by the French historical novels ''The Accursed Kings'' by Maurice Druon, which are about the French monarchy in the 13th and 14th centuries.\\n\\nThe story is written to follow principal landmarks with an ultimate destination, but leaves Martin room for improvisation.

Many fans felt that his subplot progressed overly slowly in the novels, and his meeting with Daenerys was particularly lauded.\\n\\n===Ratings===\\n\\nThe gross viewing figure per episode for the show, which include streaming, DVR recordings and repeat showings, averaged at 20 million this season.\\n\\nLive +7 ratings were not available, so Live +3 ratings have been used instead.\\n\\n\\'\\'Business Insider\\'\\' noted a significant difference in the ratings between this season and previous seasons. The typical pattern involves \"Solid premiere viewings followed by a slow but steady gain of momentum through to the finale. Historically, the finale episodes of each season have beaten the premiere for total number of viewers\". However, this season showed a significant decline from 8 million viewers at the premiere to 5.4 million at the seventh episode, \"The Gift\".

Martin, and its television adaptation ''Game of Thrones''.\\n\\nIntroduced in 1996's ''A Game of Thrones'', Sandor is the estranged younger brother of Ser Gregor Clegane, from the fictional Seven Kingdoms of Westeros. Sandor serves as King Joffrey Baratheon's personal bodyguard. He subsequently appeared in Martin's ''A Clash of Kings'' (1998), ''A Storm of Swords'' (2000), and ''A Feast for Crows'' (2005). Like his brother, Sandor is regarded as one of the fiercest and strongest fighters in the Seven Kingdoms. His face is marked by gruesome facial burns he received when his brother shoved his face into a brazier as children; ever since he has retained a crippling fear of fire. While initially appearing brutal and fatalistic, he later proves to be more sympathetic and compassionate, particularly through his relationships with Sansa and Arya Stark.\\n\\nSandor is portrayed by Scottish actor Rory McCann in the HBO television adaptation.\\n\\n== Character description ==\\nSandor Clegane, known as The Hound, was the younger brother of Gregor Clegane, and was a retainer to House Lannister. \", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 0, '_split_overlap': [{'doc_id': '7daa3a1123d0c01f71353319c9e4330', 'range': (1108, 1253)}]}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '3bfe802b60db7c49f07786e26a463ad8'}>,\n",

The cities of Slaver\\'s Bay speak related languages, descended from High Valyrian with the substrate of the local Ghiscari languages. Peterson noted that with regard to the vocabulary of the derived languages, \"If it’s got a j in an odd place, it’s probably Ghiscari in origin.\"Peterson described the relationship between High Valyrian and the Free Cities languages as being similar to that between classical Latin and the Romance languages, or more accurately between Classical Arabic and the modern varieties of Arabic, in that High Valyrian is intelligible, with some difficulty, to a speaker of a local Essoan language.\\n\\n', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 16, '_split_overlap': [{'doc_id': 'd1dc67cd8dd5b3cf0d87714586b159b4', 'range': (0, 107)}, {'doc_id': 'abe9b3ff2233faa5c1d5c182f5fc9d36', 'range': (853, 1199)}]}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '5178fa8ccd6dcf01195eff10561ca1c4'}>,\n",

It appeared in the third-season premiere episode \"Valar Dohaeris\".  Peterson created the Astapori dialogue by first writing the text in High Valyrian, then applying a series of regular grammar and sound changes to simulate the changes in natural languages over a long period of time.\\n\\nFor example, Astapori Valyrian has lost all long vowels (designated with a macron) and most diphthongs. Between vowels, b, d, g have become v, ð, ɣ; subsequently, p, t, k have become b, d, g in the same environment.\\nAs a result, an \"Unsullied\" is rendered as \\'\\'Dovaogēdy\\'\\'  in High Valyrian, but as \\'\\'Dovoghedhy\\'\\'  in Astapori.

Similarly, Astapori Valyrian has lost the case system of High Valyrian, so the word order is more reliably subject–verb–object (SVO) and the four genders of High Valyrian have been reduced to two, with three definite articles: \\'\\'ji\\'\\'  (animate singular, derived from High Valyrian \\'\\'ziry\\'\\'  \"him/her (accusative)\"), \\'\\'vi\\'\\'  (inanimate singular, derived from High Valyrian \\'\\'ūī\\'\\'  \"it (accusative)\"), and \\'\\'po\\'\\'  (plural, derived from High Valyrian \\'\\'pōnte\\'\\'  \"them (accusative)\"). There is also an indefinite article, \\'\\'me\\'\\' , derived from High Valyrian \\'\\'mēre\\'\\'  (\"one\"). Word stress is less predictable than in High Valyrian, but commands are stressed word-finally (for example: \\'\\'ivetrá\\'\\').\\n\\n=== Meereenese Valyrian ===\\n\\nMeereenese Valyrian appears in Seasons 4 and 6 of \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\'.

After his betrothed Lyanna Stark was kidnapped by Rhaegar Targaryen, Robert, along with the aid of her brother and his close friend, Eddard Stark, and their foster guardian Jon Arryn, initiated a bloody rebellion against the \"Mad King\" Aerys II Targaryen.  After crushing the Targaryen dynasty and winning the war, Robert took the Iron Throne and established the Baratheon dynasty as its first king.  However, due to Lyanna\\'s untimely death during the war, Robert instead married Tywin Lannister\\'s daughter Cersei to ensure political stability. Although Robert\\'s rule has been relatively peaceful, he proves to be an ineffective ruler and is unhappy in both his marriage to Cersei and his responsibilities as king, instead living a life of infidelity and wanton excess.
